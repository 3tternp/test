to improve the situation with the security server, a good idea to install security updates automatically.
to ensure that security updates are postedd automatically, wee have to install the unattended upgrade in our debian  based 
linux system. 

so this script works as a backend of the APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade option.

so i create this as a bash script which i found on following link 
https://securityonline.info/debian-download-install-security-upgrades-automatically/?utm_source=ReviveOldPost&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ReviveOldPost

and 
by running this script your debian based linnux system get various security based updates automaticaally


stay safe !!
